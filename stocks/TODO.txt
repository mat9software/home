---------- BUGS ----------

#1 START
Summary : Python http server block cross-origin in browser.

Details : We need to figure out how we can call a different origin from the wasm client code without blocking. Is it a problem with the server?

Impact : Not blocking for dev. Blocking for prod.

Workaround : Use chrome in unsafe mode (allow cross-origin mode)
